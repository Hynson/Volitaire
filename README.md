# Volitaire

WARNING! There's a bug that causes the enemy fire audio to peak due to being looped so fast, it's not a common bug but just keep your 
audio lowered.

You are the pilot of the Volitaire, a highly advance prototype ship capable of unleashing wanton destruction on any foe. 
Before the ship becomes an official part of your Galaxy's glorious army, you are tasked with pushing the ship to its absolute 
limit through a realistic flight simulator. Get some good test data and go make your federation proud!
